## Description

This is a Web App that scrapes the most recent essays from PaulGraham.com and creates a downloadedable ePub file for you to read them on your eReader.

The server scrapes the website, parses the content, and saves each essay as an HTML file on the server.
It then compiles and builds an ePub, which the user can download.

The web app and code are hosted on >> [Replit](https://replit.com/@vincanger/PaulG-Essay-Scraper#book.js)

### Objective

Paul Graham is an influential programmer, entrepreneur, and writer. He co-founded ViaWeb, Y Combinator, and Hacker News.

I love reading his essays, which he releases monthly on his website, but I wanted a way to read the most recent essays on my eReader on the go. This project was my solution to this problem!
