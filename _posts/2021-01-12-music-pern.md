## Objective 
This was a learning project. My goals were:
1. Create an ExpressJS API ‚úÖ
2. Connect a postgreSQL database with more than one table ‚úÖ
3. Learn and apply user authentication ‚úÖ
4. Expirement with React and make it a full-stack app ‚úÖ
5. Deploy it successfully to [Heroku](https://music-notes-pern.herokuapp.com/) ‚ùå
    - (Authentication works fine on my local machine, but doesn't after being deployed to heroku. There seems to be a problem in the front-end request. Any help in this domain would be appreciated üëç)
