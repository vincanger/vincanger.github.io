### Objective

To develop further full-stack skills and learn new languages and frameworks.

I did not get around to deploying this app, and there are a lot of loose ends, but I learned a lot about many-to-many relationships, authentication, authorization, angular and material ui, serving paginated results, testing, and a lot more.
